    <p> Learn about SelectYourFish.com, your ultimate online destination for exploring and selecting aquarium fish.
       Discover how the Selector tool simplifies finding the perfect fish for your tank and delve into the extensive fish Database for detailed species information. 
     This site provides an interactive way to search for freshwater aquarium fish based on their requirements. 
      Remember, this is all general advice. Always research each fish species before buying.
     <br>
     To browse all fish in database, go to <a href = "browse_test.html">Database.</a> 
     <br>
     To filter fish by different attributes, go to <a href = "index_test.html">Selector.</a> 
    </p>
     
    <h2>Search categories</h2>
    See each category explained below. The percentage value next to each category
    reflects the proportion of fish included out of the total <span id = "dbcount"> </span> entries in the database.
    <h2>Aquarium size</h2>
    <p> 
      This is the smallest tank size recommended for a planted aquarium without additional fish. 
      It assumes that fish which prefer to be in groups (schooling or social species) need enough space.
      It's important to look into the specific needs of different species before adding them to your aquarium.

    <h2>Water temperature</h2>
